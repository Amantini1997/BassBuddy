## What is BassBuddy?
BassBuddy is an app aimed to find and filter your bass music.

With the thousands of songs re-bass artists have produced it can sometimes be a gruelling task 
to find the songs with a specific frequency that you know will play on your audio system.

Here comes BassBuddy to rescue you:
- Scans your local music folders to generate a database (1-time setup)
- Applies genre tags to each song based off artists
- Search for songs with a specific frequency (includes a +/- range)
- Search for songs within a range of frequencies
- Search for songs with a certain genre(s)
- Quickly create new playlists to keep your music fresh
- Works with a variety of re-bass artists
