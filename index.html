                    Do you have so many re-bassed songs you find it hard to get songs that will play well on 
                    your system and you can vibe with? Well fear no more as BassBuddy is here to sort you out.
                    <br>
                    With the thousands of songs re-bass artists have produced it can sometimes be a gruelling task 
                    to find the songs with a specific frequency that you know will play on your audio system. Whereas 
                    traditional methods of searching for songs (typing in specific numbers in file explorer) can 
                    work it often takes a long time create a set of songs you’re confident will play well. Not only 
                    songs that play well it is often the case you’d wants songs with a vibe similar to yours. This 
                    is where the genre searching feature comes into play and you can filter the songs down to a 
                    certain genre(s) for that little bit extra control.
                </p>

            <p>
                Okay so if you’re like me and find a video guide useful then it may be a
                good idea to watch this short video going over how to use BassBuddy 
                and some of the features it has:
            </p>
            <img id="video-tutorial" src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x150" alt="">
            <br>
            <b>Setup:</b>
            
            <p>
                <strong>BassBuddy</strong> runs on Java so you will need Java installed 
                to run the application. While I find it unlikely for you to not have java 
                installed you can get it from <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/">https://www.java.com/en/download/</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once Java is installed, download the latest <strong>BassBuddy</strong> 
                release and you will have a folder containing <b>BassBuddy.jar</b>, <b>start.bat</b> and <b>start.sh</b>. 
                Depending on you operating system (OS) (Windows/Linux/MacOS) determines how to launch the application.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you’re on Windows use the <b>launch.bat</b></li>
                    <li>If you’re on Linux/MacOS use <b>launch.sh</b></li>
                </ul>
                On first time launch, your OS will ask for network access (It needs network access 
                to check for version changes and to connect to the genre database).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You should now be greeted by BassBuddys settings page where it 
                will ask for you to select a ‘top level folder’ which contains all your music. 
                E.g. <code>&nbsp;C:\music\rebassed&nbsp;</code>. Any folders within this folder will get scanned 
                in and it will search for mp3 files to create a local database.
                <br> 
                After this initial setup stage, you’re good to go with using BassBuddy.

                    Absolutely! I plan on keeping <strong>BassBuddy</strong> updated so long as people have 
                    a use for it. I will  say that donor feature requests are much more likely to get worked 
                    on as it’s a good incentive for myself.

                <div class="answer">
                    My method of getting songs genres is by searching a database for an artists name. Sadly 
                    this does produce some odd genres for artists with un-unique name where there may be multiple entries.

            <h1>Donate? You’re too kind 🧡</h1>
            <p>
                Firstly, I would like to thank all of you that download and use my program. It has taken many months 
                to get it to the stage where it is, and I hope that it works well for your needs. As this is a 
                free program (and will stay free) I do ask if you’ve found it useful to kindly donate. I am currently 
                studying in my final year of university but would like to continue support for <strong>BassBuddy</strong> when I find free time.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I do take in feature requests for free to improve <strong>BassBuddy</strong>, I would be much more incentivized 
                to put the time aside if the request was made by a donor (You can leave a feature request with the donation or 
                email me at <a href="mailto:BassBuddyTeeDeL@outlook.com">BassBuddyTeeDeL@outlook.com</a>).
            </p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                If the button does not work for whatever reason you can send a donation through this link 
                <a href="https://paypal.me/swiftos">https://paypal.me/swiftos</a>.
                Once again thank you to anyone that has donated, it helps a lot more than you’d expect.
